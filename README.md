- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Poppy-Ann I returned to UK in 2012 after spending 10 years on my sail boat Bear Necessities it is a 40 foot Cutter rigged Ketch which I spent 10 years just bobbing around the Caribbean where I made a lot of friends.
- I am interested in building radio controlled models, at the moment I am into radio controlled model construction machines with full working hydraulics I now have a 1:14 scale excavator which is 22Kg and has several different attachments starting with
- (1) a normal digging bucket, (2) a tilt & turn extra wide trench bucket, (3) a powered rock breaker, (4) a tilt and turn hydraulic clamshell bucket, (5) a vibrating plate compactor,  (6) a large ripper attachment for loosening hard ground.
-  along with a bulldozer, a wheeled skid steer (partly built), plus a tipper truck (partly built), a 8x8 tractor unit (still in box) plus a trailer with hydraulic ramps ( still in box).  
  
-  Iâ€™m currently looking into learning to tig weld I have seen videos showing cold welding which could be great for model building and have just bought a tig welder to practice with along with a plasma cutter that has a built in compressor which saves buying a separate  large compressor,
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on programming a similar robot to the robot dog (Spot)by Boston Dynamics  ...
